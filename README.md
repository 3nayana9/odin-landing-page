# Odin Landing Page

This is my second web project — a basic landing page built using only HTML and CSS. It’s part of The Odin Project curriculum and helped me practice layout using Flexbox. It’s not responsive yet, but it works well on desktop screens.

## Project Goals

- Practice writing clean HTML structure  
- Learn how to use CSS Flexbox to position elements  
- Understand how to style buttons, text, and sections  
- Organize a webpage into logical sections like header, hero, info, quote, and footer  
- Get more comfortable using Git and GitHub

## What I Built

A simple landing page with:

- A header with logo and navigation links  
- A hero section with a bold title, subtext, button, and image placeholder  
- A section for showing some information in boxes  
- A quote/testimonial area  
- A call-to-action (CTA) section  
- A footer with copyright

## How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
No setup or installation is required.

## What I Learned

- How Flexbox works for layout and alignment  
- How to style elements using classes and CSS properties

## Future Improvements
